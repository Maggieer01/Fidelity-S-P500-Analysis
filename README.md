# Does specific event have impact on the SP500 index?

I analyzed the Witching Day's impact on the S&P 500 index, also on the two mutual funds FXAIX and FEQIX.

In the Rmd file, I used S&P 500 data from Yahoo Finance as an example.

To replace the S&P 500 with the mutual fund data, just change the file name in the beginning.
